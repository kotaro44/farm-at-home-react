# farm-at-home-react

This is an ReactJS Demo, to run the project you only need to clone the repository, once cloned inside the repo folder just run the command:

```javascript
$ npm install
```
The command will generate the index.html of the app, so to deploy the website just run:

```javascript
$ npm start
```

Once the waiting message appears, the website should be accesible through your browser by http://localhost
